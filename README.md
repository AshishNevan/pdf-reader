# pdf-reader

# Python PDF Parser

This Python tool extracts text, tables, images, and potential charts from PDF files. It uses a combination of libraries such as `pdfplumber`, `PyMuPDF (fitz)`, and `PIL` to achieve these functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

### Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

To use the tool, we recommend Visual Studio Code for its great support for Python and ease of use. Follow the steps below to set up your environment.

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the code if you're working with local files):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository-path.git
    ```

2. **Open the project directory in VSCode**:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository-path
    code .
    ```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Ensure you have all required Python libraries installed. The easiest way is to use a `requirements.txt` file, which contains the necessary libraries for the project.

1. **Install dependencies** using pip:

    Open the integrated terminal in VSCode and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Step 3: Running the Script (`parser.py`)


To run the script, execute the following command in your VSCode terminal:

```bash
python parser.py
```
